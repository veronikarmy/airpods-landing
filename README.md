## Description
This project is a practice work as part of my frontend learning journey. I followed a step-by-step YouTube tutorial to reinforce my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, as well as to learn how to upload a complete project to GitHub.

The project demonstrates how to create a clean, minimalistic landing page with interactive elements.

## What I'm Learning
- Building layouts using **flexbox**, positioning, spacing, and working with SVG files.
- Basic JavaScript for interactive page elements:
  - `querySelector`
  - `addEventListener`
  - `classList.toggle` (or similar methods).
- Organizing file structure (images, CSS, and JS folders).
- Uploading projects to GitHub using Git.

## Features
- Change AirPods color on click.
- Stylish hover effect on buttons.
- Minimalistic, clean design.

## Installation & Usage
```bash
git clone git@github.com:veronikarmy/airpods-landing.git
cd airpods-landing

Then, open the index.html file in your browser.
```
